# Project-3-Repo
Our group chose to take on the concept of informing franchise investors on which fast food chain fits them best.
We approached it by looking at the nutritional value to see what kind of food you are puting out into the public. 
We observed and mapped the locations where fast food chains were thriving.
We also looked at the finanicals of each of the major fast food companies as well.
